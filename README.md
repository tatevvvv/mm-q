To describe the Mastermind game using a system of qubits and define the game states and state vectors, we need to represent the sequence of colored pins, the guesses, and the feedback within the quantum framework.

### Qubit Representation

1. **Colors and Positions**:
   - Assume we have \( k \) colors and \( n \) positions.
   - Each color can be represented by \( \log_2(k) \) qubits.
   - Each position can be represented by a set of qubits corresponding to the color at that position.

2. **Secret Sequence**:
   - The secret sequence can be encoded as a quantum state \(|s\rangle\) where \( s \) is a combination of colors at \( n \) positions.
   - For example, if \( k = 4 \) colors (00, 01, 10, 11) and \( n = 2 \) positions, the secret sequence might be represented as a 4-qubit state.

3. **Guess**:
   - Similarly, each guess can be represented as a quantum state \(|g\rangle\) with \( n \log_2(k) \) qubits.

4. **Feedback**:
   - Feedback is the number of correct positions, which can be represented as a quantum state \(|f\rangle\).
   - The feedback state could use \( \log_2(n+1) \) qubits to represent values from 0 to \( n \).

### State Vectors

1. **Secret Sequence State**:
   - \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|s_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color at position \( i \).

2. **Guess State**:
   - \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |g_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|g_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color guessed at position \( i \).

3. **Feedback State**:
   - \(|f\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(n+1)\)-qubit state representing the number of correct positions.

### System of Qubits and Game States

1. **Initial State**:
   - The initial state of the system is a superposition of all possible sequences \(|s\rangle\) and guesses \(|g\rangle\).
   - \(|\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f\)
   - Here, \(|0\rangle_f\) represents the initial feedback state.

2. **Guess and Feedback Update**:
   - After making a guess \(|g\rangle\), the feedback is computed based on the overlap with the secret sequence \(|s\rangle\).
   - A unitary operation \( U_f \) updates the feedback state based on the guess:
     \[ U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]
   - Here, \( f(s,g) \) represents the number of correct pins in their correct positions.

3. **Measurement and State Collapse**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\) where \(|f\rangle\) is the observed feedback.

### Example with 2 Colors and 2 Positions

Assume \( k = 2 \) (colors 0 and 1) and \( n = 2 \) (positions):

1. **Qubit Representation**:
   - Each color is represented by 1 qubit (0 or 1).
   - Each position is represented by 1 qubit.
   - Secret sequence and guess are represented by 2 qubits each.
   - Feedback is represented by 2 qubits (values 0 to 2).

2. **States**:
   - Secret sequence \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle\) where \( |s_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Guess \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle\) where \( |g_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Feedback state \(|f\rangle\) with possible values 0, 1, or 2.

3. **Initial State**:
   \[ |\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \]

4. **After Guess**:
   - Suppose the guess \(|g\rangle\) is made, and the unitary operation \( U_f \) is applied:
   \[ U_f \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]

5. **Measurement**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to one specific \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\).

This quantum representation of the Mastermind game sets the foundation for implementing quantum algorithms that can potentially solve the game more efficiently than classical algorithms.





To design quantum gates that implement the operations of the sequential classical Mastermind algorithm, we will focus on the key steps: initializing the states, performing the guess, updating based on feedback, and measuring the result. Here’s a step-by-step guide to designing these quantum gates:

### 1. Initialization

#### Initializing the Secret Sequence
The secret sequence is chosen by the keeper and can be represented as:
\[ |s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle \]
Each \(|s_i\rangle\) is a qubit representing the color at position \(i\).

#### Initializing the Guess State
The guess state is initialized to a superposition of all possible guesses:
\[ |\psi_g\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{g} |g\rangle \]
This can be achieved using the Hadamard gate \(H\) on each qubit if \(k = 2\):
\[ H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{g} |g\rangle \]

### 2. Applying the Feedback Function

#### Feedback Operation
The feedback function compares the guess with the secret and updates the feedback register. The unitary operation \(U_f\) computes the number of correct positions:
\[ U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]

To implement this, we use controlled operations and ancillary qubits to count the number of correct positions.

### 3. Example Gates and Circuits

#### Controlled-NOT Gates (CNOT)
CNOT gates can be used to compare each position of the guess with the corresponding position of the secret:
\[ \text{CNOT}(|s_i\rangle, |g_i\rangle) \]

#### Toffoli Gates
Toffoli gates (CCNOT) can be used to increment a feedback register if the guess matches the secret at a given position:
\[ \text{CCNOT}(|s_i\rangle, |g_i\rangle, |f_j\rangle) \]

### 4. Full Quantum Circuit

Here is a step-by-step outline of the quantum circuit to implement the sequential classical algorithm in the context of Mastermind:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Secret Sequence
The secret sequence is fixed and not part of the superposition:
\[ |s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle \]

#### Step 2: Initialize the Guess State
Use Hadamard gates to create a superposition of all possible guesses:
\[ |\psi_g\rangle = H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} \]

#### Step 3: Initialize the Feedback Register
Initialize a feedback register with enough qubits to store the feedback value:
\[ |0\rangle_f \]

#### Step 4: Apply Controlled-NOT and Toffoli Gates
For each position \(i\):
1. Use CNOT gates to compare the guess and the secret.
2. Use Toffoli gates to update the feedback register based on the comparison.

#### Step 5: Measurement
Measure the feedback register to obtain the feedback value. Use this value to inform the next guess.

### Quantum Circuit Example (For \(k=2\), \(n=2\))

Here is a simple example with 2 positions and 2 colors (binary case):

```plaintext
|s1> --•-----•--
       |     |
|g1> --X--•  |
         |  |
|s2> --•--X--•--
       |     |
|g2> --X-----X--
          
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
```

1. **Secret Qubits**: \( |s_1\rangle \) and \( |s_2\rangle \)
2. **Guess Qubits**: \( |g_1\rangle \) and \( |g_2\rangle \)
3. **Feedback Qubits**: \( |0\rangle \) initialized ancillary qubits to store feedback

In this example:
- The CNOT gates compare the guess with the secret.
- The CCNOT gates (not explicitly shown here due to simplification) update the feedback register based on the comparison results.
- The feedback register is updated according to the number of correct positions.

### Conclusion
This quantum circuit approach can be generalized for larger values of \(n\) and \(k\). For non-binary cases, use more qubits to represent each color and adapt the gates accordingly. The key operations involve initializing superpositions, applying feedback functions using controlled gates, and measuring the feedback register to guide subsequent guesses.





To parallelize the move search in Mastermind using quantum gates applied to superposition states, we need to leverage the principles of quantum parallelism and interference. The goal is to create a quantum circuit that can evaluate multiple possible guesses simultaneously, update based on feedback, and use quantum interference to amplify the correct sequence.

### Quantum Parallelism in Mastermind

1. **Superposition Initialization**:
   - We initialize the guess register to a superposition of all possible guesses.
   - For \(n\) positions and \(k\) colors, each position can be in one of \(k\) states. Hence, we need \(\log_2(k)\) qubits per position.
   - The initial state for \(n\) positions can be represented as:
     \[
     |\psi_g\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{g \in [k]^n} |g\rangle
     \]
   - Using Hadamard gates for \(k = 2\) or generalized Hadamard-like gates for larger \(k\), we initialize the guess register to this superposition.

2. **Secret Sequence Representation**:
   - The secret sequence \(|s\rangle\) is a fixed state chosen by the keeper and encoded in the circuit.

3. **Feedback Calculation**:
   - We need to design a quantum oracle that computes the feedback for each guess in parallel.
   - The feedback will be stored in ancillary qubits.

### Quantum Circuit Design

#### Step 1: Initialize Superposition

Initialize the guess register to a superposition of all possible guesses.

For \(k = 2\):
\[
|\psi_g\rangle = H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n}
\]
where \(H\) is the Hadamard gate.

For larger \(k\):
\[
|\psi_g\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{g \in [k]^n} |g\rangle
\]

#### Step 2: Apply the Quantum Feedback Function

Implement a unitary operator \(U_f\) that encodes the feedback into ancillary qubits based on the secret sequence and the guess.

For each guess \(g\) and secret \(s\), \(U_f\) computes the feedback \(f(s,g)\):
\[
U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle
\]

This requires controlled operations and Toffoli gates to count the correct positions.

#### Step 3: Interference and Amplification

Use Grover's algorithm or a similar quantum search algorithm to amplify the correct guess.

1. **Oracle Marking**: Mark the states with maximum feedback (i.e., where \(f(s,g) = n\)):
   \[
   O_f |g\rangle = 
   \begin{cases} 
   -|g\rangle & \text{if } f(s,g) = n \\
   |g\rangle & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Diffusion Operator**: Apply the diffusion operator to amplify the marked states:
   \[
   D = 2|\psi_g\rangle \langle \psi_g| - I
   \]

### Complete Quantum Circuit Example

Here’s a simplified example for \(k=2\) (binary colors) and \(n=2\) positions:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Guess register: \( |g\rangle = H^{\otimes 2} |00\rangle \)
   - Feedback register: \( |f\rangle = |00\rangle \)

2. **Quantum Feedback Function \(U_f\)**:
   - Controlled operations and Toffoli gates to compute \(f(s,g)\).

3. **Oracle Marking \(O_f\)**:
   - Mark the states where \(f(s,g) = 2\).

4. **Diffusion Operator \(D\)**:
   - Apply the diffusion operator to amplify the correct guesses.

       |     |   |   |                    |     |        |
|g1> --X--•  |---| H |--------------------|     |--------|
         |  |   |   |                    |     |        |

       |     |   |   |                    |     |        |

|0> ---| CCNOT |--| CCNOT |--| CCNOT |---| U_f |--| O_f |--| D |
```

### Steps Explained:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Apply Hadamard gates to the guess qubits to create a superposition.
   - Initialize feedback qubits to \(|0\rangle\).

2. **Feedback Calculation**:
   - Use controlled operations (CNOT and Toffoli gates) to compare each guess qubit with the corresponding secret qubit and update the feedback qubits accordingly.

3. **Oracle Marking**:
   - Apply a phase flip (oracle marking) to the states where the feedback register indicates all correct positions (i.e., \(f(s,g) = 2\)).

4. **Diffusion Operator**:
   - Apply the diffusion operator to amplify the probability amplitude of the correct guess states.

### Conclusion

By applying these quantum gates to the superposition states, we parallelize the move search, allowing the quantum algorithm to evaluate multiple guesses simultaneously and leverage quantum interference to find the correct sequence efficiently. This approach demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving combinatorial problems like Mastermind.
