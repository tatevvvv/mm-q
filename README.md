To describe the Mastermind game using a system of qubits and define the game states and state vectors, we need to represent the sequence of colored pins, the guesses, and the feedback within the quantum framework.

### Qubit Representation

1. **Colors and Positions**:
   - Assume we have \( k \) colors and \( n \) positions.
   - Each color can be represented by \( \log_2(k) \) qubits.
   - Each position can be represented by a set of qubits corresponding to the color at that position.

2. **Secret Sequence**:
   - The secret sequence can be encoded as a quantum state \(|s\rangle\) where \( s \) is a combination of colors at \( n \) positions.
   - For example, if \( k = 4 \) colors (00, 01, 10, 11) and \( n = 2 \) positions, the secret sequence might be represented as a 4-qubit state.

3. **Guess**:
   - Similarly, each guess can be represented as a quantum state \(|g\rangle\) with \( n \log_2(k) \) qubits.

4. **Feedback**:
   - Feedback is the number of correct positions, which can be represented as a quantum state \(|f\rangle\).
   - The feedback state could use \( \log_2(n+1) \) qubits to represent values from 0 to \( n \).

### State Vectors

1. **Secret Sequence State**:
   - \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|s_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color at position \( i \).

2. **Guess State**:
   - \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |g_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|g_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color guessed at position \( i \).

3. **Feedback State**:
   - \(|f\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(n+1)\)-qubit state representing the number of correct positions.

### System of Qubits and Game States

1. **Initial State**:
   - The initial state of the system is a superposition of all possible sequences \(|s\rangle\) and guesses \(|g\rangle\).
   - \(|\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f\)
   - Here, \(|0\rangle_f\) represents the initial feedback state.

2. **Guess and Feedback Update**:
   - After making a guess \(|g\rangle\), the feedback is computed based on the overlap with the secret sequence \(|s\rangle\).
   - A unitary operation \( U_f \) updates the feedback state based on the guess:
     \[ U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]
   - Here, \( f(s,g) \) represents the number of correct pins in their correct positions.

3. **Measurement and State Collapse**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\) where \(|f\rangle\) is the observed feedback.

### Example with 2 Colors and 2 Positions

Assume \( k = 2 \) (colors 0 and 1) and \( n = 2 \) (positions):

1. **Qubit Representation**:
   - Each color is represented by 1 qubit (0 or 1).
   - Each position is represented by 1 qubit.
   - Secret sequence and guess are represented by 2 qubits each.
   - Feedback is represented by 2 qubits (values 0 to 2).

2. **States**:
   - Secret sequence \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle\) where \( |s_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Guess \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle\) where \( |g_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Feedback state \(|f\rangle\) with possible values 0, 1, or 2.

3. **Initial State**:
   \[ |\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \]

4. **After Guess**:
   - Suppose the guess \(|g\rangle\) is made, and the unitary operation \( U_f \) is applied:
   \[ U_f \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]

5. **Measurement**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to one specific \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\).

This quantum representation of the Mastermind game sets the foundation for implementing quantum algorithms that can potentially solve the game more efficiently than classical algorithms.
