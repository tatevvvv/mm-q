To describe the Mastermind game using a system of qubits and define the game states and state vectors, we need to represent the sequence of colored pins, the guesses, and the feedback within the quantum framework.

### Qubit Representation

1. **Colors and Positions**:
   - Assume we have \( k \) colors and \( n \) positions.
   - Each color can be represented by \( \log_2(k) \) qubits.
   - Each position can be represented by a set of qubits corresponding to the color at that position.

2. **Secret Sequence**:
   - The secret sequence can be encoded as a quantum state \(|s\rangle\) where \( s \) is a combination of colors at \( n \) positions.
   - For example, if \( k = 4 \) colors (00, 01, 10, 11) and \( n = 2 \) positions, the secret sequence might be represented as a 4-qubit state.

3. **Guess**:
   - Similarly, each guess can be represented as a quantum state \(|g\rangle\) with \( n \log_2(k) \) qubits.

4. **Feedback**:
   - Feedback is the number of correct positions, which can be represented as a quantum state \(|f\rangle\).
   - The feedback state could use \( \log_2(n+1) \) qubits to represent values from 0 to \( n \).

### State Vectors

1. **Secret Sequence State**:
   - \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|s_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color at position \( i \).

2. **Guess State**:
   - \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |g_n\rangle\)
   - Each \(|g_i\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(k)\)-qubit state representing the color guessed at position \( i \).

3. **Feedback State**:
   - \(|f\rangle\) is a \(\log_2(n+1)\)-qubit state representing the number of correct positions.

### System of Qubits and Game States

1. **Initial State**:
   - The initial state of the system is a superposition of all possible sequences \(|s\rangle\) and guesses \(|g\rangle\).
   - \(|\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f\)
   - Here, \(|0\rangle_f\) represents the initial feedback state.

2. **Guess and Feedback Update**:
   - After making a guess \(|g\rangle\), the feedback is computed based on the overlap with the secret sequence \(|s\rangle\).
   - A unitary operation \( U_f \) updates the feedback state based on the guess:
     \[ U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]
   - Here, \( f(s,g) \) represents the number of correct pins in their correct positions.

3. **Measurement and State Collapse**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\) where \(|f\rangle\) is the observed feedback.

### Example with 2 Colors and 2 Positions

Assume \( k = 2 \) (colors 0 and 1) and \( n = 2 \) (positions):

1. **Qubit Representation**:
   - Each color is represented by 1 qubit (0 or 1).
   - Each position is represented by 1 qubit.
   - Secret sequence and guess are represented by 2 qubits each.
   - Feedback is represented by 2 qubits (values 0 to 2).

2. **States**:
   - Secret sequence \(|s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle\) where \( |s_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Guess \(|g\rangle = |g_1\rangle \otimes |g_2\rangle\) where \( |g_i\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\} \).
   - Feedback state \(|f\rangle\) with possible values 0, 1, or 2.

3. **Initial State**:
   \[ |\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \]

4. **After Guess**:
   - Suppose the guess \(|g\rangle\) is made, and the unitary operation \( U_f \) is applied:
   \[ U_f \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{s,g} |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]

5. **Measurement**:
   - Measurement collapses the state to one specific \(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f\rangle\).

This quantum representation of the Mastermind game sets the foundation for implementing quantum algorithms that can potentially solve the game more efficiently than classical algorithms.





To design quantum gates that implement the operations of the sequential classical Mastermind algorithm, we will focus on the key steps: initializing the states, performing the guess, updating based on feedback, and measuring the result. Here’s a step-by-step guide to designing these quantum gates:

### 1. Initialization

#### Initializing the Secret Sequence
The secret sequence is chosen by the keeper and can be represented as:
\[ |s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle \]
Each \(|s_i\rangle\) is a qubit representing the color at position \(i\).

#### Initializing the Guess State
The guess state is initialized to a superposition of all possible guesses:
\[ |\psi_g\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^n}} \sum_{g} |g\rangle \]
This can be achieved using the Hadamard gate \(H\) on each qubit if \(k = 2\):
\[ H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{g} |g\rangle \]

### 2. Applying the Feedback Function

#### Feedback Operation
The feedback function compares the guess with the secret and updates the feedback register. The unitary operation \(U_f\) computes the number of correct positions:
\[ U_f(|s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |0\rangle_f) = |s\rangle \otimes |g\rangle \otimes |f(s,g)\rangle \]

To implement this, we use controlled operations and ancillary qubits to count the number of correct positions.

### 3. Example Gates and Circuits

#### Controlled-NOT Gates (CNOT)
CNOT gates can be used to compare each position of the guess with the corresponding position of the secret:
\[ \text{CNOT}(|s_i\rangle, |g_i\rangle) \]

#### Toffoli Gates
Toffoli gates (CCNOT) can be used to increment a feedback register if the guess matches the secret at a given position:
\[ \text{CCNOT}(|s_i\rangle, |g_i\rangle, |f_j\rangle) \]

### 4. Full Quantum Circuit

Here is a step-by-step outline of the quantum circuit to implement the sequential classical algorithm in the context of Mastermind:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Secret Sequence
The secret sequence is fixed and not part of the superposition:
\[ |s\rangle = |s_1\rangle \otimes |s_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |s_n\rangle \]

#### Step 2: Initialize the Guess State
Use Hadamard gates to create a superposition of all possible guesses:
\[ |\psi_g\rangle = H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} \]

#### Step 3: Initialize the Feedback Register
Initialize a feedback register with enough qubits to store the feedback value:
\[ |0\rangle_f \]

#### Step 4: Apply Controlled-NOT and Toffoli Gates
For each position \(i\):
1. Use CNOT gates to compare the guess and the secret.
2. Use Toffoli gates to update the feedback register based on the comparison.

#### Step 5: Measurement
Measure the feedback register to obtain the feedback value. Use this value to inform the next guess.

### Quantum Circuit Example (For \(k=2\), \(n=2\))

Here is a simple example with 2 positions and 2 colors (binary case):

```plaintext
|s1> --•-----•--
       |     |
|g1> --X--•  |
         |  |
|s2> --•--X--•--
       |     |
|g2> --X-----X--
          
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
       |     |
|0> ---|CCNOT|---
```

1. **Secret Qubits**: \( |s_1\rangle \) and \( |s_2\rangle \)
2. **Guess Qubits**: \( |g_1\rangle \) and \( |g_2\rangle \)
3. **Feedback Qubits**: \( |0\rangle \) initialized ancillary qubits to store feedback

In this example:
- The CNOT gates compare the guess with the secret.
- The CCNOT gates (not explicitly shown here due to simplification) update the feedback register based on the comparison results.
- The feedback register is updated according to the number of correct positions.

### Conclusion
This quantum circuit approach can be generalized for larger values of \(n\) and \(k\). For non-binary cases, use more qubits to represent each color and adapt the gates accordingly. The key operations involve initializing superpositions, applying feedback functions using controlled gates, and measuring the feedback register to guide subsequent guesses.
